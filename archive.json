      "body": "Based on Jun Zhang's comments during the adoption call, (see [here](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/lake/nqF1JP86m_bQnWD2BfZea5i16_0/)), some assumptions in the Section _Assumptions_ are too strong. In short, there is a conflict between the texts in Section _Assumptions_ and Section _Remote Attestation over EDHOC_. The case where the Verifier cannot handle the evidence format provided by the Attester is already covered in section _Remote Attestation over EDHOC_, it seems unnecessary to state in Section _Assumptions_ that \"The Verifier is assumed to know how to verify multiple formats of the evidence type.\".\n\nContext: \n- Section _Assumptions_ states: \u201cThe Verifier is assumed to know how to verify multiple formats of the evidence type.\u201d \n- Secition _Remote Attestation over EDHOC (5.2.1.1.2)_ states: \u201cIn case none of the evidence types is supported, the Relying Party rejects the first message_1 with an error indicating support for another evidence type.\u201c\n\nWe can improve in two ways:\n1. Specify that the assumption in Section _Assumptions_ regarding the Verifier\u2019s knowledge of multiple evidence formats applies only when remote attestation is successfully completed. Additionally, consider moving the description of evidence format mismatches from Section _Remote Attestation over EDHOC_ to Section 8 _Error Handling_, for better coherence.\n2. Related to #1 , if we simplify the protocol by assuming a pre-existing relationship between the Attester and the Verifier, we can eliminate the need for evidence format negotiation. In this case, we would only need to add an assumption about the pre-existing relationship in Section Assumptions, and the statement regarding multiple evidence formats could be removed entirely.",
